                                x0 I/O API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



.: Requirements :.

We want the I/O system to meet at least the following requirements:

- *thin* and *clean* *API* design.
- fully *non-blocking* I/O support
- *multiplexing* support (via libev at least)
- data to be passed from source to sinks must be *filterable*
- acceleratable I/O: special system calls (such as *sendfile()*) shall be supported.

Although, the API does not need to exceed the requirements of the
*x0 HTTP server project*, though, it is unlikely, that we will implement
a SocketSource class, for example.



.: API Design :.

The I/O API is following the source/sink-approach, where an I/O path has two
ends, the source (class *Source*) and the destination (class *Sink*).
On the way through, the data (also known as a *Chunk*) may be filtered
(class *Filter*), but the data may take a short-cut when no
data-filtering is required.

We want to provide different types of sources, sinks, and filters.
Though, we provide a common base class for each of the above with the
minimum actions in common and will provide specialized classes to implement
the actual derivate (e.g. *FileSource* or *SocketSink*).



.: Class Hierarchy :.

    Buffer                  : an in-memory dynamically growing memory region.
    BufferRef               : a view into a sub-region of its referring buffer.

    Source                  : abstract base class for chunk producer
        BufferSource        : in-memory chunk producer (reads from this buffer)
        SystemSource        : system-handle chunk producer (reads from its handle)
            FileSource      : chunk producer for regular files
        FilterSource        : combines a source with a filter, producing filtered chunks
        CompositeSource     : composes an ordered set of chunks into a virtual single one.

    SinkVisitor             : visitor-pattern interface for the sink types below.

    Sink                    : abstract base class for chunk consumer
        BufferSink          : in-memory chunk consumer (writes into this buffer)
        FileSink            : chunk consumer for regular files
        SocketSink          : writes chunks into a network socket

    Filter                  : abstract base class for chunk transformer
        NullFilter          : does not transform at all (a classic NULL filter)
        CompressFilter      : base class for compressing filters
            DeflateFilter   : compresses with deflate-algorithm
                GZipFilter  : compresses with gzip-algorithm
            BZip2Filter     : compresses with bzip2-algorithm
        ChainFilter         : passes incoming chunks through a chained list of filters.
        ChunkedEncoder      : wraps incoming data into chunked transfer encoding.



.: I/O flow :.

When copying data from one end to another (e.g. a file from a server to a client)
common semantics are found:

  - The server's file is called *Source* and the client is our *Sink*.

  - But as we can't assume to just send the whole source as one big blob to
    our sink, we will divide it into smaller ones, which we call *Chunk*.

  - Sometimes we wish to transform the data before finally pumping it to
    the sink - this will be done by the chunk transformer, the *Filter*.

The source is represented as a data stream and splitted dynamically
into (smaller) chunks:

  - produced by a source (chunk producer),

  - possibly transformed by a filter, and finally

  - consumed by a sink (chunk consumer).



.: Chunks :.

A chunk is an array of bytes, represented in memory.
We (re-)use the class *Buffer* and *BufferRef* as they serve exactly
what we require.



.: Sources (Chunk Producer) :.

The *Source* class abstracts all kinds of chunk producers (files, buffers,
network sockets, composite set of different source types).

abstract interface:
    virtual ssize_t sendto(Sink& sink);

Every source specialization needs to implement the function(s) above.

A source is always mutable, that means, if you read from it, at least its read
position offset is adjusted accordingly to continue reading from that position
on next invokation. This applies to every source object.



.: Sinks (Chunk Consumer) :.

Sinks will actually consume the chunks produced, thus, writing into a network
socket, a memory region, or regular file onto your local filesystem.

abstract interface:
    virtual ssize_t ssize_t write(const void *buffer, size_t size);
    virtual void accept(SinkVisitor& visitor);

Each sink implementation must implement the methods above. The *write()*
method is usually invoked by the *Source* objects *sendto()* method
unless it does not provide a more intelligent way to accelerate
the data transfer (like splice() and sendfile() system-calls for
copy-free data transfer).



.: Compositing Soources :.

There is one special type of source (*CompositeSource*) that is used to
create a complex source by compositing multiple (different types of)
sources together into one linear stream.



.: Filters (Chunk Transformer) :.

Filters stand between the actual source and its sink to possibly
*transform* the transferring chunks.

Possible use-cases are compressors, chunked transfer encoders or even
template engines (e.g. XSLT on XML formatted sources) to "transform"
the data to be transferred from one form into another before actually
copying it into the sink.

Filters are created on demand for a fixed source and sink.

abstract interface:
    virtual Buffer process(const BufferRef& input, bool eof);

Each filter is must implement the above method, which is invoked repeatily
over all produced chunks, and where its input parameter represents
the chunk to filter (transform) and eof is the flag, indicating whether
or not this is last chunk within this stream, thus, this is the last
invokation of *process()* before this filter is destroyed again.
