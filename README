x0 - WEB SERVER - http://code.ninchens.net/projects/x0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORE FEATURE ROADMAP:
- configurable at runtime (via dbus)
- plugin API and loadable modules
- multiple virtual hosts, different modules for different features:
  - simple (like lighttpd's mod_vhost_simple)
  - customizable (my)sql based mod_vhost_sql
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0
- HTTP pipelining
- plaintext and SSL connections. (and the new mixed one, that apache invented?)
- async sendfile()-use when serving static files

MODULES:
- auth: implements HTTP authentication
- accesslog: writes HTTP requests to an access log file (in spirit of apache httpd's common access log format)
- cgi: handles CGI requests (files ending with a specified ending, e.g. ".cgi" and alike).
- dbus: administrative plugin to (re-)configure server at runtime.
- dirlisting: generates a directory listing response in case the request path maps to a directory instead of a file directly.
- indexfile: internally redirects to index.html (or other, if configured) if request path maps to a directory that contains an index file.
- redirect:
- rewrite:
- sendfile: sends static files to client if requested entity maps to a local file.
- userdir: provides access to user's ~/public_html directory as hostname/~username URL
- vhost: implements basic virtual hosting

THREADING MODEL:
- main thread performing I/O dispatching
- client threads processing the client requests and actions
- main thread and client threads communicate through queues
- avoid lockings as much as possible (but use them where needed!)

REUQEST PROCESS FLOW (EBNF style):

http_connection_acceptor ::=
	connection_open
	(
		pre_process
			resolve_document_root
			resolve_entity
			generate_content
			request_done
		post_process
	)*
	connection_close

EVENT-TO-MODULE RELATION:

connection_open: ssl
	pre_process:
		resolve_document_root: vhost
		resolve_entity: userdir, indexfile
		generate_content: dirlisting, sendfile
		request_done: accesslog
	post_process:
connection_close: ssl
