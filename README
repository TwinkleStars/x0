-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORE FEATURE ROADMAP:
- configurable at runtime (via dbus)
- plugin API and loadable modules
- multiple virtual hosts, different modules for different features:
  - simple (like lighttpd's mod_vhost_simple)
  - customizable (my)sql based mod_vhost_sql
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0
- HTTP pipelining
- plaintext and SSL connections. (and the new mixed one, that apache invented?)
- async sendfile()-use when serving static files

MODULES:
- redirect
- rewrite
- auth
- user_dir
- dbus
- cgi/fastcgi
- accesslog
- directory-listing
- directory-indexing
- static files

THREADING MODEL:
- main thread performing I/O dispatching
- client threads processing the client requests and actions
- main thread and client threads communicate through queues
- avoid lockings as much as possible (but use them where needed!)

REUQEST PROCESS FLOW (EBNF style):

http_connection_acceptor ::=
	connection_open
	(
		pre_process
			resolve_document_root
			resolve_entity
			generate_content
			request_done
		post_process
	)*
	connection_close

EVENT-TO-MODULE RELATION:

connection_open: ssl
	pre_process:
		resolve_document_root: vhost
		resolve_entity: userdir, indexfile
		generate_content: dirlisting, sendfile
		request_done: accesslog
	post_process:
connection_close: ssl
