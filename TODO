INTERMEDIATE TODO

for a long-term todo list, see ticket system at http://code.ninchens.net/projects/x0

- util:
	- new settings API
		1.) port TSettings to x0: `settings`
			datatypes supported: int, double, string, bool, map<K, V>, vector<V>
		2.) develop a settings visitor who imports the settings into the context scheme to at least match server-/vhosts contexts
	- chain API (or just a std::deque/std::list?)
		- filter chain API using the above/chain API
- core:
	- rfc_date-cache (Last-Modified, Date) i can't do simple caching of last active unix-time as the 
	  last-modified field shards this, i should use a cache<time_t, std::string> of configurable max-cost value.
	- async/parralel content generator handlers
	- handle request headers Keep-Alive properly (using asio [deadline-]timers)
	- make composite_buffer move constructable/assignable-only, that is, also remove copy constructor/assignment operator
- dirlisting:
	- themable index page via the lua-driven template engine i wrote for YaCS.
	  (maybe use this then also for an error plugin which generates themable error pages)
- docs:
	- bring API docs up-to-date.
- modules:
	- proxy (http), required to replace apache on ninchens.net server
		- must support live streams (required for YaCS chat stream)
		- must support fallback nodes (required for YaCS/maintenance)
	- ssl (via gnutls!), required for ninchens.net server
	- fastcgi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES AND THOUGHTS:
- should the upcoming (lua driven) template engine be part of x0 core?
  (we'll have more sources than just error documents being generated from templates, that is plugins like: dirlisting.
- cgi plugin:
  - find a way to get notified on SIGCHLD which should be caught in asio's io_service on EINTR's.
    hm. or just use sigaction/etc...? but what if other plugins may want to hook into SIGCHLD aswell?
	that's why we need a central place where we can register our check callback for it.
- sendfile plugin:
  - rename to "localfile", as it served local files, 
    though, leaving room for other plugins to serve static files aswell, but from a different storage source.
- ssl plugin:
  - idea 1: will need to hook into connection reader/writer.
    for the latter, it will need to provide its own composite_buffer writer atop of the standard socket writer
  - idea 2: idea: the connection class should provide read/write methods, and we'll provide a connection writer for composite_buffer instead.
    though, the ssl plugin (and deflate, e.g.) will just need to override the reader/writer for this connection.
  - idea 3: the ssl plugin hooks into the listener's accept() and creates an ssl aware socket, however, this REQUIRES
    all sockets (plain and ssl) to know about sendfile/writev for composite_buffer then).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIMIZATION AND CACHING INITIATIVE

- core optimizations:
  - server time string for "Date" header
  - optimize composite_buffer appending by merging nearby iovec chunks,
      if the left back and the right front is an iovec_chunk, and
      if the sum of both iovec elements does not exceed the system's iovec limit to writev(2)
- sendfile optimizations:
  - mtime strings for "Last-Modified" header
  - ETags-cache for files (we could trigger these on stat invalidation in stat-cache)

- improve configuration system
	- based on hierarichal contexts (with use of ternary_search<>)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
bool chat_listener::handle_request(request& in, response& out)
{
	this->request = &in;
	this->response = &out;

	out.header("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8");

	out.write(chatStreamHead());

	out.incomplete(true);// explicit flush indicates that there *MIGHT* be more to come, but we flush what we have.
	out.flush(); 

	return true;
}

void channel::say(const message& msg)
{
	for (auto i = members.begin(), e = members.end(); i != e; ++i)
	{
		auto member = *i;
		member->write(message);
	}
}
void member::write(const message& msg) {
	listener->response->write(msg.text());
	listener->response->flush();
}
void ChatSession::~ChatSession() {
	listener->response->finish();
}

response::finish() {
	flush();
}
response::flush() {
	ios.post(do_flush());
}
response::do_flush() {
	// write remaining data.
}
