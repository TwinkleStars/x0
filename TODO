INTERMEDIATE TODO

for a long-term todo list, see ticket system at code.ninchens.net/projects/x0

- configuration system
	- based on hierarichal contexts (with use of ternary_search<>)
- command line argument parsing/handling
	- either very simple, by making use of getopt or libpopt
	- or fully featured by porting my libnuggad's argument evaluator.
- daemonize()'ing.
	- program arg "-X" should prevent from daemonizing.
- logging system
	- add syslog driver
- multi threaded multiplexing: per-CPU model
