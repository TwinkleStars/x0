Q) Why yet another web server?
A) x0 is not just a web server, it's a philosophy you should live through.
I developed web server add-ins in quite a number of web servers already and even tiny
selfcontained http server classes for some projects, each with their own focused strengths.
Since it seems that I'm not getting out of the HTTP-topic since quite a few years and
probably won't for quite another few, I at least want a solid web server foundation I can
build my projects and addons on - and this includes all what x0 stands for.

Q) What does the word "x0" stand for.
A) It stands for zero (or nearly zero) latency.
The software aims to achieve this by being as asynchronous as possible,
and caches where possible without breaking the HTTP protocol or significantly
loosing features.
Although, I lay a high emphasis on using Linux-native features not available to other 
operating systems or are even quite young if that helps me improving performance.
Other POSIX/UNIX-like operating systems may still compile, thanks to #ifdef.

Q) How to pronounce "x0".
A) Either as those two letters (x-zero), or just zero - what you like the most.

Q) Why is x0 using libev instead of Asio/Boost.Asio?
A) Because it's faster.

Q) Will there be a Win32-version of x0?
A) Some day. But not today.

Q) Why is x0 *requiring* such a new GCC version X.Y.Z?
A) People not willing to upgrade their toolchain, are likely not brave enough to pull in security update either.
Why bothing about those guys when newer GCC/whatever compiler provide the better C++ features, namely
those coming from C++0x e.g.
