C++0x is the name of the new C++ standard, which is partially supported by 
the GNU C++ [1] compiler already.

Most importanly and though probably used by this software project:

* variadic templates
* auto typed variables
* strongly typed enums
* initializer lists
* defaulted and deleted functions

Not yet implemented by GCC (4.4) but very useful:

* lambda expressions and closures
* null pointer constant (nullptr)
* concepts (especially ranges)
